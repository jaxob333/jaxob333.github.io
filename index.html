<h1 id="sports">Sports</h1>
<p>I am an avid fan of sports. Sports is a big part of my life. My favorite sports are football,soccer and basketball. 
I do watch a little of baseball but I am not much of a fan.
My favorite basketball team is the <em>Philadelphia 76ers</em>. 
More specifically my favorite player is <strong>Joel Embiid</strong>. 
I also am a big fan of the Memphis Grizzlies.
In the NFL I am a huge fan of the <em>Green Bay Packers</em>. In my opinion <strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong> is the G.O.A.T. Also I must add that all Bears fans should give up
on this season. My favorite MLS soccer team is probably the Nashville SC and my favorite international team is probably Manchester United or Chelsea. 
I do watch some baseball but not a lot. My favorite team has to be the St. Louis Cardinals. I also must add that the reason I am into sports is because
of the life lessons it teaches. Sports teach cooperation, heart and helps create a work ethic in people. What I mean by heart is the willpower to never
give up when things seem rough and tough. </p>
<p>(P.S): Enjoy a mini slide show of my favorite players.

<p>I am currently a student at the University of Missouri. I enjoy this school and beautiful city of Columbia. I feel at home at this university. The community and locals are really nice. But back to myself, I am a sophomore. My major is currently <strong>Information Technology</strong>. Currently my classes are decent and are very interesting. I was in Computer Science at first but switched to IT during the second semester of my freshman year.The reason I chose IT/Computer Science field in the first place was because I have been around computers my whole life. So I wanted to do something with computers. The more I learn about IT the more I really want to learn how to code better because I dont really know that much off the top of my head. I came into my major as a rookie and I wish to catch up to my peers.

<p>I feel like now would be a good time to link some address of some IT friendly sites.</p>

<h1 id="coding">Coding</h1>
<p>So far I have taken quite of bit of coding classes in college. Before I came to college I had no experience in coding. So learning how to code on campus is still kind of hard to this day but its not that hard to learn. But I have a huger disadvantage compared to my peers because they have coded some before they came to college. </p>
<p>Here are a list of some languages I have dabbled in since taking classes at Mizzou. </p>
<ul>
<li>C</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>C#</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of these five languages I am most comfortable with C# and Python. HTML and JavaScript are pretty decent with me but I am so terrible at C and can barely code anything in C. </p>
<p>Also here is a little demo code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">html</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">body</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">h2</span>&gt;</span>This is a random decimal number generator. Pretty cool right!<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">h2</span>&gt;</span>


<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">p</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"demo"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">p</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span><span class="javascript">
<span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.getElementById(<span class="hljs-string">"demo"</span>).innerHTML = <span class="hljs-built_in">Math</span>.random();
</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">body</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">html</span>&gt;</span>

        <h1 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h1>
<p>One of my favorite hobbies is to watch <strong>ANIME</strong>. Anime is something that I enjoy and think that teaches important lessons. I have learned to never give up and to push on thanks to anime. My favorite anime of all time has to be That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime. Before watching this show my opinoin of slimes were trash. I thought they were bottom feeders that noobs would destroy to quickly level up to level 2. But after this show slimes skyrocketed in my eyes. Now I think that all slimes are overpowered beings that must be kept alive at all costs. But enough about anime.</p>

<p>I also enjoy working out sometimes. I feel like working out is good place to connect with my inner self because when your lifting weights its you and only you that can lift the weights. </p>

<p>I have a few more hobbies but I do not want to take up anymore of your time so I will start my conclusion. </p>
<h1 id="brief-conclusion">Brief Conclusion</h1>
<p> <em>I am a sophomore at the University of Missouri that is an IT Major that enjoys anime and other mundane activites that a normal person would enjoy.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time:)</p>
