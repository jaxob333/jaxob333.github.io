<p>One of my favorite hobbies is to watch <strong>ANIME</strong>. Anime is something that I enjoy and think that teaches important lessons. I have learned to never give up and to push on thanks to anime. My favorite anime of all time has to be That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime. Before watching this show my opinoin of slimes were trash. I thought they were bottom feeders that noobs would destroy to quickly level up to level 2. But after this show slimes skyrocketed in my eyes. Now I think that all slimes are overpowered beings that must be kept alive at all costs. But enough about anime.</p>

<p>I also enjoy working out sometimes. I feel like working out is good place to connect with my inner self because when your lifting weights its you and only you that can lift the weights. </p>
