<p>I am currently a student at the University of Missouri. I enjoy this school and beautiful city of Columbia. I feel at home at this university. The community and locals are really nice. But back to myself, I am a sophomore. My major is currently <strong>Information Technology</strong>. Currently my classes are decent and are very interesting. I was in Computer Science at first but switched to IT during the second semester of my freshman year.The reason I chose IT/Computer Science field in the first place was because I have been around computers my whole life. So I wanted to do something with computers. The more I learn about IT the more I really want to learn how to code better because I dont really know that much off the top of my head. I came into my major as a rookie and I wish to catch up to my peers.

<p>I feel like now would be a good time to link some address of some IT friendly sites.</p>
